#  sfPdfEditor

## üöÄ Introduction

**sfPdfEditor** is a Salesforce-based project that enables **PDF display and editing** directly within Salesforce using **Lightning Web Components (LWC)** and **Apex**.

It relies on the **sfPdfEditorLib** library, which integrates **PDF.js, Fabric.js, and PDF-LIB** to provide advanced PDF manipulation capabilities.

‚ö† **Note:**  
The **Salesforce code** is released under the **MIT license**, while the **sfPdfEditorLib** library, although included as a *static resource*, **cannot be modified** by users. However, it can be used as is.

## üéØ **Key Features**
- üìÑ **Display** PDFs stored in Salesforce.
- ‚úè **Edit** PDFs (currently supports adding text, with future enhancements for shapes, signatures, and more).
- üîÑ **Component interaction**:
  - `pdfSelector` (provided as an example) lists the **10 most recent PDFs** in Salesforce and sends the selected file ID to `pdfViewer`.
  - `pdfViewer` displays and enables editing of the selected PDF.
  - Once modified, `pdfViewer` sends the updated file to `pdfSelector`, which **saves it back to Salesforce**.
- üîó **Seamless Salesforce integration** via LWC and Apex.
